## How JWT Logout Works (In Simple Terms)

**What happens when you "log out" with JWT tokens:**

- JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication is *stateless*. This means the server does not keep track of who is logged inâ€”the token itself contains all the information needed to authenticate a user.
- When you log in, the server gives you a token. You (the client) store this token, usually in localStorage or a cookie.
- For every request, you send this token to the server to prove who you are.

**Logging out with JWT:**

- The simplest way to log out is to delete the token from your browser's storage (localStorage or cookies). Without the token, you can't make authenticated requests anymore.
- However, just deleting the token on your device does NOT make it invalid everywhere. The token is still technically valid until it expires, and if someone else got a copy, they could still use it.

**Why JWT logout is tricky:**

- Unlike traditional session-based logins, you can't "kill" or invalidate a JWT token on the server after it's been issued. The server has no built-in way to know a token should be considered "logged out" before it expires.
- This means that if you want to force a token to become invalid (for example, if a user logs out or their account is compromised), you need extra logic.


## Solutions for "Real" Logout

| Method | Description | Trade-offs |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Remove token client-side | Delete JWT from localStorage/cookies. User can't authenticate anymore from this device. | Simple, but token is still valid elsewhere until it expires. |
| Short token expiry | Make tokens expire quickly (e.g., 15 minutes). | Reduces risk, but may annoy users with frequent logins. |
| Blacklist tokens | Keep a list (in your database or cache) of tokens that should not be accepted anymore. | Requires checking the blacklist on every request, which adds server-side state and complexity. |

**How blacklisting works:**

- When a user logs out, add their token to a blacklist.
- On every request, check if the token is on the blacklist. If it is, reject the request.
- This method gives you true "logout," but you lose some of the stateless benefits of JWT, since you now need to check a database or cache for every request.


## Summary

- JWT logout is not as simple as deleting a session on the server.
- The basic step is to delete the token from the client, but this does not truly invalidate the token.
- For stricter logout, you need to implement a blacklist or use short-lived tokens.
- Blacklisting adds server-side checks, making JWT less "stateless," but it is necessary if you want to force tokens to become invalid immediately after logout.
